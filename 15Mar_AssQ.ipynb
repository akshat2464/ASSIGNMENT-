    "Q1: Explain the following with an example\n",
    "C) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI can be used for tasks such as speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n",
    "Example: Siri, Apple's voice-activated assistant, uses AI to understand and respond to user queries.\n",
    "<) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters use machine learning to identify and move spam emails to the junk folder based on patterns and features in the data.\n",
    "I) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data.\n",
    "Example: Autonomous driving technology uses deep learning to process data from sensors and cameras to recognize objects and make driving decisions.\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "Supervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns from the input-output pairs and makes predictions based on that learning.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Linear Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM): Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "Random Forest: Predicting patient outcomes based on medical history.\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that does not have labeled responses. The algorithm tries to learn the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "K-means Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance.\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering: Organizing documents into a hierarchical structure for better search and retrieval.\n",
    "Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider \"smart.\"\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to improve their performance on a task with data.\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to analyze complex patterns in data.\n",
    "Data Science (DS): An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses AI, ML, and DL.\n",
    "Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train the model. Examples include regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "Semi-Supervised Learning: Uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. It is useful when acquiring a fully labeled dataset is expensive or time-consuming. Examples include semi-supervised support vector machines and semi-supervised clustering.\n",
    "Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "Train Split: The portion of the dataset used to train the model. The model learns from this data.\n",
    "Test Split: The portion of the dataset used to evaluate the model's performance. It tests how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
    "Validation Split: The portion of the dataset used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. It helps in preventing overfitting and ensuring that the model performs well on an independent dataset.\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Data: Used to fit the model and learn the parameters.\n",
    "Validation Data: Helps in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Test Data: Provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model.\n",
    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "Explanation: Unsupervised learning can identify patterns in data without prior labels. In anomaly detection, it can be used to identify outliers or abnormal instances that do not conform to the learned patterns.\n",
    "Example: Clustering algorithms like K-means can group normal data points together, and points that do not fit well into any cluster can be considered anomalies.\n",
    "Q8: List down some commonly used supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
