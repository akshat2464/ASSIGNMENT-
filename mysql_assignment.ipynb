    "'''DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL used to define, modify, and manage database schema and objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL commands are used to create, alter, and delete database structures but do not manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common DDL Commands with Examples\n",
    "1. CREATE\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Creating a table named Employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    DateOfBirth DATE,\n",
    "    Position VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "2. DROP\n",
    "The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, or entire databases. This operation is irreversible and removes all data within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Dropping the Employees table:\n",

    "\n",

    "3. ALTER\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, delete, or modify columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Adding a new column Salary to the Employees table:\n",

    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
